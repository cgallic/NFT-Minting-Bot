# NFT Minting Bot
This repo showcases two examples on how *smart contracts* can be used to *mass mint NFTs in a single transaction*.\
Bot implementations may vary significantly between each NFT drop as most NFT smart contracts have unique Mint functions

- [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) (Smart Contract Developer Framework)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/) (Blockchain Interaction)
- [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/cro/) (Node provider)

## Contribution
If you find any issues or ways that this methodolgy could be improved create a pull request and it will be merged into the main branch if accepted.

*This repo has been created for educational purposes and as a tool for myself and others to learn how to implement various web3 tools to conduct tasks such as writing/deploying/testing/interacting with smart contracts. I do not endorse the usage of bots to gain an unfair advantage over regular onchain users.*
